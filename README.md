# Road Segmentation For Cal Poly Pomona 
The goal of this project is for the automation project at Cal Poly Pomona that creates masks for the sidewalk currently. The scope of the project will eventually increase and more issues will be created, but for now just a mask for sidewalks/roads. 

# Issues 

# Goals 
 - [ ] Develop a system for the Camera to detect sidewalks/roads
 - [ ] Eventually develop a RCNN from scratch for LIDAR/Camera
 - [ ] Finetune the current RCNN using pytorch RCNN and truly understand the mathematics behind the current training
